An experimental rewrite of Enjarify in Go and Rust for performance. Warning: it will probably not be maintained or kept in sync with the Python version.

To build the Go version, set your GOPATH to the go directory (or copy it into your existing GOPATH) and then run
    go build enjarify-go

To build the Rust version, switch to the enjarify-rs directory and run
    cargo build --release.

This is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it is just code that happens to be owned by Google.
