An experimental rewrite of Enjarify in Go for performance. Warning: it will probably not be maintained or kept in sync with the Python version.

To build, set your GOPATH to the go directory (or copy it into your existing GOPATH) and then run go build enjarify.


### Disclaimer

This is not an official Google product (experimental or otherwise), it is just code that happens to be owned by Google.
